This repository summarized several elastoplastic constitutive models, which are given in the time-integrated fully implicit form. Some classical stresss point simulations are also provided. A detailed directory tree diagram is shown as follows, which suggests that these constitutive models are considered: (1) ideal Drucker-Prager plasticity; (2) Modified Cam-Clay in which the isotropic elastic matrix is updated explicitly; (3) anisotropic MCC model for transversely isotropic rocks such as shale; (4) saturation-dependent anisotropic elasticity.
